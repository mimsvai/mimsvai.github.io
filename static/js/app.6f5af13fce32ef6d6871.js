sensations, whereas the ability to interact with the system depends on an unobtrusive interface and intuitive input modalities. Rapid technological advances have greatly improved the user experience; however, VR/AR system developers are striving to further enhance the realism of VR/AR applications by incorporating multiple sensory inputs, including visual systems of greater sophistication, haptic feedback, auditory cues, and olfactory sensations. Developers are also seeking to employ a diversity of input modalities, such as eye gaze, voice, and gesture to enable seamless interactions with the virtual/augmented environment. Nonetheless, VR/AR developers are struggling to provide users with an experience that is as realistic and immersive as those experienced in the real world.</span></p><br><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.7; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 19px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">The Multiple Input Modalities and Sensations for VR/AR Interactions (MIMSVAI 2023) workshop will be a one-day face-to-face gathering of researchers in the fields of ubiquitous computing (UbiComp) and VR/AR. Note that attendees planning to attend the workshop in Cancún Mexico on October 8th/9th, 2023 will be expected to register for the UbiComp/ISWC 2023 main conference. Our initial efforts will be aimed at developing research momentum in the UbiComp community by calling for papers on the design of input modalities and sensory feedback mechanisms aimed at enhancing the immersive quality of the VR/AR experience and facilitating computer-user interactions. We arrange sessions for each accepted paper to be presented in the workshop. At the end of each session, we will assign session chairs to mediate the discussion to distill motivated ideas and findings to the participants. Besides the regular sessions, we will invite one expert for VR/AR interactions to give talks in the morning. We hope the keynote presentation can bring in more interesting perspectives regarding VR/AR-related researches. In this year, we further incorporate discussion sessions in the afternoon to engage workshop attendees in productive brainstorming and discussion to generate more potential challenges or ideas to enable more immersive VR/AR experiences. Finally, we will deliver the closing remarks and give the best paper award to the best paper presented at the MIMSVAI 2023 workshop to acknowledge and encourage excellence in research.

This workshop discusses the challenges and applications of designing a higher coherence between different input modalities and sensations to offer more engaging VR/AR experiences, which can create opportunities for the researchers from both UbiComp and VR/AR fields to jointly discuss and brainstorm alternative input modalities and sensations for VR/AR interactions.</p>\n\n                <h1>Topics</h1>\n\n                <p>Papers may include, but not be limited to, topics such as:</p>\n\n                <ul>\n                    <li>2D/3D and volumetric display and projection technology</li>\n                    <li>Immersive analytics and visualization</li>\n                    <li>Modeling and simulation</li>\n                    <li>Multimodal capturing and reconstruction</li>\n                    <li>Scene description and management issues</li>\n                    <li>Storytelling</li>\n                    <li>Tracking and sensing</li>\n                    <li>Audio interfaces, sound rendering, spatialized audio, auditory perception and psychoacoustics</li>\n                    <li>Embodied agents, virtual humans and (self-)avatars</li>\n                    <li>Haptic and tactile interfaces, wearable haptics, passive haptics, pseudo haptics, other touch-based UI</li>\n                    <li>Mediated and diminished reality</li>\n                    <li>Multimodal input and output</li>\n                    <li>Multisensory rendering, registration, and synchronization</li>\n                    <li>Perception and cognition</li>\n                    <li>Presence, body ownership, and agency</li>\n                    <li>Teleoperation and telepresence</li>\n                    <li>3D user interaction</li>\n                    <li>3D UI metaphors</li>\n                    <li>Collaborative interactions</li>\n                    <li>Ethical issues</li>\n                    <li>Human factors and ergonomics</li>\n                    <li>Input devices</li>\n                    <li>Locomotion and navigation</li>\n                    <li>Multimodal/cross-modal interaction and perception</li>\n                    <li>Non-fatiguing 3D UIs</li>\n                    <li>Non-visual interfaces (such as olfactory)</li>\n                    <li>Touch, tangible and gesture interfaces</li>\n                    <li>Usage research, evaluation methods and empirical studies</li>\n                    <li>Domain-specific VR/AR applications.</li>\n                    <li>Design process, platform/tools, or libraries used to incorporate input modalities or sensations for VR/AR interactions or studying their use</li>\n                </ul>\n\n                <h1>Important Dates</h1>\n\n                <p>Paper submission: 23:59 (AoE), <s>July 29, 2022</s> August 5, 2022&nbsp;</p>\n\n                <p>Paper notification: 23:59 (AoE), <s>August 21, 2022</s> August 26, 2022</p>\n\n                <p>Camera-ready: 23:59 (AoE), September 2, 2022</p>\n\n                <p>Workshop: September 11, 2022</p>\n\n                <h1>Best Paper Award</h1>\n\n                <p>The Best Paper Award is given to the best paper presented at the MIMSVAI 2022 workshop, to acknowledge and encourage excellence in research.

Our early research explored how people express physically emotions when communicating with 3D avatars. Then, we investigated how the haptic feedback supplements the facial expression of 3D avatars to improve their emotional expressivity and to remove the ambiguity of perception of some close emotions. In this context, we used new methods based the “Information Integration Theory” to study and model the way in which people combine haptic and visual information to perceive emotions. With the same methodology, we investigated other interpersonal communication configurations, in particular, Human-Robot Social Interaction. The objective was to improve the social capacities of robot in daily life (handshake, etc.).</p>",biography:'<p><a href="http://www.mehdi-ammi.eu" target="_blank">Mehdi Ammi</a> is Professor at the University of Paris 8.

Then, in the &rsquo;70s, personal computers &ldquo;moved in&rdquo; with users. In the &rsquo;90s, mobile devices moved computing into users&rsquo; pockets. More recently, wearable devices brought computing into constant physical contact with the user&rsquo;s skin. These transitions proved useful: moving closer to users allowed interactive devices to sense more of their user and act more personal. The main question that drives my research is: </span><strong>what is the next interface paradigm that supersedes wearable devices?</strong></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The primary way researchers have been investigating this is by asking where future interactive devices will be located with respect to the user&rsquo;s body. Many posit that the next generation of interfaces will be implanted inside the user&rsquo;s body. However, I argue that their location with respect to the user&rsquo;s body is not the primary factor; in fact, implanted devices are already happening in that we have pacemakers, insulin pumps, etc. Instead, I argue that the key factor is how will devices </span><strong>integrate</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with the user&rsquo;s biological senses and actuators.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This body-device integration allows us to engineer interactive devices that intentionally borrow parts of the body for input and output, rather than adding more technology to the body. For example, one such type of body-integrated devices, which I have advanced recently, are interactive systems based on electrical muscle stimulation. These devices are able to move their user&rsquo;s muscles using computer-controlled electrical impulses, achieving the functionality of robotic exoskeletons without the bulky motors.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They key insight of my research is that engineering devices that intentionally borrow parts of the user&rsquo;s biology puts forward a </span><strong>new</strong> <strong>generation of miniaturized devices</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">; allowing us to circumvent traditional physical constrains. For instance, in the case of our devices based on electrical muscle stimulation, they demonstrate how our body-device integration circumvents the constrains imposed by ratio of electrical power and size of a motor (i.e., the stronger/larger a motor is, more current needed to actuate it). Similarly, we demonstrate how our body-device integration approach </span><strong>even allowed us to miniaturize thermal feedback</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (hot/cold sensations) without the need for power-hungry devices like Peltiers, air conditioners or heaters.</span></p>',biography:'<p><a href="https://lab.plopes.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;color: rgb(17, 85, 204);text-decoration: underline;">Pedro Lopes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is an Assistant Professor in Computer Science at the University of Chicago, where he leads the </span><strong>Human Computer Integration lab</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">.
